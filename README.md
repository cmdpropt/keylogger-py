🛡️ pyKeylogger – A Python-Based Advanced Keylogger (For Educational Use Only)
⚠️ Disclaimer: This tool is intended strictly for educational and ethical research purposes. Any malicious usage, including unauthorized access to systems or data, is strictly prohibited and illegal. The developers are not responsible for any misuse.

🧠 What is pyKeylogger?
pyKeylogger is a feature-rich Python-based keylogger designed for educational exploration of monitoring software. It showcases how keystroke logging works and expands into multi-vector surveillance, sending the gathered information securely to a remote server.

Keyloggers are activity-monitoring tools that log every key press on a system. This project demonstrates how modern keyloggers can be enhanced with audio, screenshot, clipboard, and system info logging, coupled with encrypted remote transmission using Twilio.

🚀 Features
🔑 Logs all keystrokes silently in the background

🖼️ Takes screenshots at regular intervals

🎙️ Records microphone input

🖥️ Captures system details and IP address

📋 Monitors clipboard activity

☁️ Sends all collected data securely using Twilio

🔐 Encrypts all logs using Asymmetric Key Encryption

🧹 Deletes local files after successful transmission for stealth

🔄 Easy integration and modular design for further expansion

⚙️ How to Use?
⚠️ Make sure to use this responsibly and only on systems you own or have permission to test.

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyKeylogger.git
cd pyKeylogger
2. Install the Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Generate Encryption Key
bash
Copy
Edit
python GenerateKey.py
Copy the generated key into DecryptFile.py and Keylogger.py.

4. Start the Keylogger
bash
Copy
Edit
python Keylogger.py
📌 Note
All data is AES-encrypted, then sent using Twilio API.

Logs are deleted after sending to maintain stealth.

You can decrypt the received files using DecryptFile.py on the remote server.

🔒 Legal and Ethical Use
This tool is developed for educational purposes to help developers and researchers understand how keylogging and data exfiltration mechanisms work. DO NOT use this software to violate anyone’s privacy or breach computer systems without proper authorization.

Sure! Here's a clean and professional repository description for a Python-based keylogger, suitable for GitHub:

🔐 Python Keylogger – Advanced Keystroke Monitoring & Data Exfiltration Tool (For Educational Use Only)
A powerful keylogger built with Python that records user keystrokes along with screenshots, microphone input, clipboard data, and system information. Collected data is encrypted using asymmetric encryption and securely sent to a remote server via Twilio API. Designed to demonstrate how modern keyloggers work and to educate cybersecurity researchers on system vulnerabilities.
